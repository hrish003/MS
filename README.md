A not-so-basic landing page just to work on some knowledge and practice .

My first hands-on website when i have included whatever i learnt till now , still a lot missed because not every website requires everything .

The website is on the topic of a marshmallow store website naming MARSHMALLOW STUDIO with custom logo made by me .
The website furthur includes a little bit of javascript for some optimisation on smaller devices otherwise the entire thing is based on HTML and CSS .
There are some cool transitions as well as hovering effects over texts as well as images .
Still there are a lot more skills that needs to be developed that I'll be putting in the furthur websites i create . Stay Tuned !!!!
